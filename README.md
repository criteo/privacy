# Privacy

Teams across Criteo are actively engaged in industry dialog about new technologies that can ensure a healthy ecosystem and preserve core business models. Online discussions (e.g on GitHub) of technology proposals should not be interpreted as commitments about Criteo products or services.

## Proposals

- [TEETAR: Testing Environment Enabling Truthful and Actionable Results](./TEETAR/README.md)
- [BINOCULARS: a measurement and reporting framework in the privacy sandbox](./lab/BINOCULARS/README.md)
